# Welcome

This is a guide for using a Nintendo Switch with CFW (**C**ustom **F**irm**w**are). This guide does NOT cover setting one up, only **using** it (running homebrews, enabling cheats, etc.).

This guide is primarily aimed at people who have not set up their own Switch CFW (if you've done that, you likely know how to use it). Rather, if you've set up a CFW for someone else, they can refer to this guide.

## Setup

This guide was based on the resulting setup by following this [rentry guide](https://rentry.org/SwitchHackingIsEasy).

## Using This Guide

Use the navigation (sidebar or hamburger menu) to explore the various topics. A good place to start is the [definitions section](guide/definitions.md), then [the one-pager](guide/one-pager.md).
